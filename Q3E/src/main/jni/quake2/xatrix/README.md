# The Reckoning for Yamagi Quake II

The Reckoning for Yamagi Quake II is a bugfixed version of the first
official missionpack released for Quake II. It's based upon the Quake
II SDK source code and licensed under GPL version 2:

* [LICENSE](https://github.com/yquake2/xatrix/blob/master/LICENSE)

Hundreds of bugs were fixed and some convenience features added. The
missionpack is intended to be used with Yamagi Quake II, but it's also
fully backward compatible with the last Quake II pointrelease 3.20 and
may work with other source ports.

Officially supported operating systems are:

* FreeBSD
* Linux
* Windows

Beside theses The Reckoning for Yamagi Quake II has community support
for MacOS and most other unixoid operating systems, including NetBSD,
OpenBSD and Solaris.
